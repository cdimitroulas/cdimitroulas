### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christos Dimitroulas, a software engineer working for [Formula.Monks](https://www.formula.co/). I've mostly worked with Typescript, though I also have some experience
with C#, Ruby and most recently Go.

I also have a particular interest in functional programming and therefore enjoy working with Haskell in my free time. I enjoy mentoring students on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/dashboard) in the Haskell track.
